# ACE Framework v2.1

> **AI-assisted Code Engineering Framework**
> A rigorous, IDE-agnostic standard for professional development teams using AI agents. Treats AI interactions as structured transactions, not casual conversations.

## v2.1 Features

- **Discuss Phase**: Pre-planning alignment to capture "soft" requirements.
- **XML Tasks**: Structured implementation plans for better Agent adherence.
- **Atomic Execution**: Enforced "One Task = One Commit" workflow.

## Core Pillars

1.  **BMAD Cycle**: Analyze → Discuss → Plan → Execute → Verify.
2.  **Agentic Roles**: 7 specialized personas (Architect, Developer, QA, etc.).
3.  **Active Context**: Persistent session management via `ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`.
4.  **Regression Guards**: Proactive protection against regressions.
